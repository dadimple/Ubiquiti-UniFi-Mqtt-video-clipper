Save a videoclip at a specific timestamp from a camera recorded on a Ubiquiti UniFi Cloudkey. 
The timestamp is obtained via MQTT (epoch time, example 1711964257). The recording time 
before and after the timestamp can be set. 
This script should be scheduled every minute. Therefore, a maximum of one clip per minute can be saved.
